# Important notice:

We are currently working on cleaning up the project.
Also we are in the middle of style cleanup, so there can be a lot of broken things.

For maximum compatibility, please use the
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/alxchk/pupy/).

To pull the docker image, run: `docker pull alxchk/pupy:unstable`.

If you do not have docker installed, the simplest way to install docker on
Linux is: run `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com > docker_installer.sh`, and
execute the script with `bash ./docker_installer.sh` as root. Before executing
the file, please verify that the content has not been tampered with in transit,
as there is no automatic integrity checking.

If you do not know how to use Docker, please refer to their
[documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started).


# Pupy

## Quick docker install and configure

Lots of things are in various states of
development but this will get a server up for
you. I can confirm the linux clients work and the
windows clients build.

I've confirmed this easy method on debian sid,
but it stands to reason it should work anywhere
docker does.
If you don't have an id_rsa.pub file, create one
with ssh-keygen
Just run it without arguments
```
docker pull alxchk/pupy:unstable
docker run -d -p 2022:22 -v /tmp/projects:/projects alxchk/pupy:unstable
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /tmp/projects/keys/authorized_keys
ssh -p 2022 pupy@127.0.0.1
```
Grats your in a pupy shell, lets build a client and export it.
```
config set gen os linux
gen -D /projects/default/
```
You can find your pupy clients in /tmp/projects/default on the host.
You can now use help to find commands, edit the config, generate
clients, etc.. You'll want to use the -D
/projects/default/ when generating clients, it
makes it easy to pop back over on your
host machine and pull them out of
/tmp/projects/default since those volumes are
bound together.

If you can't make a shared key or otherwise
refuse to, you can try docker exec but be careful
not to break your container.
```
docker exec -it <container name> <command>
```
I'd recommend using a shell as a command if you
go this route, else you lose your tab competion.

Enjoy! Much appreciation to alxchk for all of his
hard work.

## Description

Pupy is an opensource, cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool mainly written in python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. Pupy can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), load remote python code, python packages and python C-extensions from memory.
Pupy modules can transparently access remote python objects using rpyc to perform various interactive tasks.
Pupy can generate payloads in multiple formats like PE executables, reflective
DLLs, pure python files, powershell, apk, ...  When you package a payload, you
can choose a launcher (connect, bind, ...), a transport (ssl, http, rsa, obfs3,
scramblesuit, ...) and a number of "scriptlets". Scriptlets are python scripts
meant to be embedded to perform various tasks offline (without requiring a
session), like starting a background script, adding persistence, starting a
keylogger, detecting a sandbox, ...

## Installation

[Refer to the wiki](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy/wiki/Installation)

## Features

- Multi-platform (tested on windows xp, 7, 8, 10, kali linux, ubuntu, osx, android)
- On windows, the Pupy payload can be compiled as a reflective DLL and the whole python interpreter is loaded from memory. Pupy does not touch the disk :)
- pupy can also be packed into a single .py file and run without any dependencies other that the python standard library on all OS
	- pycrypto gets replaced by pure python aes && rsa implementations when unavailable
- Pupy can reflectively migrate into other processes
- Pupy can remotely import, from memory, pure python packages (.py, .pyc) and compiled python C extensions (.pyd, .so). The imported python modules do not touch the disk.
- Pupy is easily extensible, modules are quite simple to write, sorted by os and category.
- A lot of awesome modules are already implemented!
- Pupy uses [rpyc](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc) and a module can directly access python objects on the remote client
  - We can also access remote objects interactively from the pupy shell and you even get auto-completion of remote attributes!
- Communication transports are modular, stackable and awesome. You could exfiltrate data using HTTP over HTTP over AES over XOR. Or any combination of the available transports !
- Pupy can communicate using obfsproxy [pluggable transports](https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en)
- All the non interactive modules can be dispatched to multiple hosts in one command
- Commands and scripts running on remote hosts are interruptible
- Auto-completion for commands and arguments
- Custom config can be defined: command aliases, modules automatically run at connection, ...
- Interactive python shells with auto-completion on the all in memory remote python interpreter can be opened
- Interactive shells (cmd.exe, /bin/bash, ...) can be opened remotely. Remote shells on Unix & windows clients have a real tty with all keyboard signals working fine just like a ssh shell
- Pupy can execute PE exe remotely and from memory (cf. ex with mimikatz)
- Pupy can generate payloads in various formats : apk,lin_x86,lin_x64,so_x86,so_x64,exe_x86,exe_x64,dll_x86,dll_x64,py,pyinst,py_oneliner,ps1,ps1_oneliner,rubber_ducky
- Pupy can be deployed in memory, from a single command line using pupygen.py's python or powershell one-liners.
- "scriptlets" can be embeded in generated payloads to perform some tasks "offline" without needing network connectivity (ex: start keylogger, add persistence, execute custom python script, check_vm ...)
- tons of other features, check out the implemented modules

## Implemented Transports
All transports in pupy are stackable. This mean that by creating a custom
transport conf (pupy/network/transport/<transport_name>/conf.py), you can make
you pupy session looks like anything. For example you could stack HTTP over
HTTP over base64 over HTTP over AES over obfs3 :o)

- rsa
	- A layer with authentication & encryption using RSA and AES256, often stacked with other layers
- aes
	- layer using a static AES256 key
- ssl (the default one)
	- TCP transport wrapped with SSL
- ssl_rsa
	- same as ssl but stacked with a rsa layer
- http
	- layer making the traffic look like HTTP traffic. HTTP is stacked with a rsa layer
- obfs3
	- [A protocol to keep a third party from telling what protocol is in use based on message contents](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt)
	- obfs3 is stacked with a rsa layer for a better security
- scramblesuit
	- [A Polymorphic Network Protocol to Circumvent Censorship](http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/)
	- scramblesuit is stacked with a rsa layer for a better security
- udp
	- rsa layer but over UDP (could be buggy, it doesn't handle packet loss yet)
- other
	- Other layers doesn't really have any interest and are given for code examples : (dummy, base64, XOR, ...)

## Implemented Launchers (not up to date, cf. ./pupygen.py -h)

Launchers allow pupy to run custom actions before starting the reverse connection
- connect
	- Just connect back
- bind
	- Bind payload instead of reverse
- auto_proxy
	- Retrieve a list of possible SOCKS/HTTP proxies and try each one of them. Proxy retrieval methods are: registry, WPAD requests, gnome settings, HTTP_PROXY env variable

There is no documentation. Sorry. But you can help us to write one.

## FAQ

> Does the server work on windows?

No. (Or maybe, but you shouldn't)

> I can't install it, how does it work?

First try to have a look at the Installation section in the wiki.
There are not so many things which can go wrong. Check:

1. Git checkout was successful. From time to time submodules may be rebased and checkout may fail in between.
2. You do have python 2.7, toolchains docker etc.
3. You have enough space to checkout and build all the things. At least 5-6 GB for docker images and 500 MB for pupy.
4. From time to time some python deps may become broken. In such case try to use version from repo.
